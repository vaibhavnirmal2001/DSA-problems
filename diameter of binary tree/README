The diameter/width of a tree is defined as the number of nodes on the longest path between two end nodes. 

The diagram below shows two trees each with a diameter of nine, the leaves that form the ends of the longest path are shaded
(note that there is more than one path in each tree of length nine, but no path longer than nine nodes). 
I have implemented this code in c++.
